just run the .sh file and it will take a "print" of all the processes running on your computer and it will be stored at the pprints folder
note: when the pprints folder is with 97 prints the next time you try to take a "print" it will ask you to delete all the "prints" on the folder and continue but if you refuse the "print" will not be taken

note2: you need all the files on the foldert named pprints on your home dir. for the program to run properly.
